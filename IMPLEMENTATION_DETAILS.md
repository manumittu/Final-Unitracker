## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Canteen Management System

#### Backend Architecture
- **Routes:** `/api/canteen/menu` and `/api/canteen/booking`
- **Authentication:** All routes protected with JWT authentication
- **Authorization:** Admin-only routes for menu CRUD operations
- **Data Models:**
  - Menu: itemName, category, price, availability, prepTime, imageUrl
  - Booking: userId, studentId, name, date, timeSlot, foodItem, quantity, paymentMode, specialInstructions, confirmed

#### Frontend Features
- **Admin Interface:**
  - Add/Edit/Delete menu items
  - View all orders from all users
  - Full CRUD operations on menu

- **Student/Professor Interface:**
  - Browse available menu items
  - Place orders with detailed information
  - View personal order history
  - Cancel own orders

- **UI Components:**
  - Menu item cards with grid layout
  - Order form with validation
  - Order history list
  - Responsive design (1-3 columns)

### 2. Lost & Found Enhancements

#### Changes Made
- Modified filter logic to show ALL items when "Found Items" is selected
- Added "Claim Item" button to all item cards
- Claim functionality shows contact info and downloads details
- Maintained existing lost/found filtering for other views

#### User Experience
- Users browsing found items can see both lost and found items
- Claiming an item provides contact information
- Automatic download of item details for offline reference

### 3. Authentication Role Fix

#### Changes Made
- Role dropdown moved inside `!isLogin` conditional
- Added two new roles: "Canteen Staff" and "Bus Staff"
- Total of 5 roles now available: Student, Professor, Admin, Canteen Staff, Bus Staff

#### User Experience
- Role selection only appears during signup (not login)
- Cleaner login form (removed unnecessary field)
- All roles properly supported in backend and frontend

## API Endpoints

### Canteen API
```
GET    /api/canteen/menu          - Get all menu items (authenticated)
POST   /api/canteen/menu          - Create menu item (admin only)
PUT    /api/canteen/menu/:id      - Update menu item (admin only)
DELETE /api/canteen/menu/:id      - Delete menu item (admin only)

GET    /api/canteen/booking       - Get bookings (own or all if admin)
POST   /api/canteen/booking       - Create booking (authenticated)
PUT    /api/canteen/booking/:id   - Update booking (owner or admin)
DELETE /api/canteen/booking/:id   - Delete booking (owner or admin)
```

## Database Schema

### Menu Collection
```javascript
{
  itemName: String (required),
  category: String,
  price: Number (default: 0),
  availability: Boolean (default: true),
  prepTime: String,
  imageUrl: String,
  timestamps: true
}
```

### Booking Collection
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User, required),
  studentId: String,
  name: String,
  date: Date (default: Date.now),
  timeSlot: String,
  foodItem: String (required),
  quantity: Number (default: 1),
  paymentMode: String (default: 'Cash'),
  specialInstructions: String,
  confirmed: Boolean (default: false),
  timestamps: true
}
```

## Role-Based Access Control

### Canteen Module Access
- **Admin:** Full CRUD on menu items, view all orders, cancel any order
- **Student:** View menu, place orders, view own orders, cancel own orders
- **Professor:** View menu, place orders, view own orders, cancel own orders
- **Canteen Staff:** View menu, place orders, view own orders, cancel own orders
- **Bus Staff:** No special canteen access (general user access)

### Dashboard Access
All roles can see the Canteen Management card on the dashboard with appropriate descriptions.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Students can view menu
- [ ] Students can place orders
- [ ] Students can view their own orders
- [ ] Students cannot see other users' orders
- [ ] Professors can order food
- [ ] Canteen Staff can order food
- [ ] Role dropdown shows 5 roles during signup
- [ ] Role dropdown does not show during login
- [ ] Lost items appear in found items section
- [ ] Claim button works and shows contact info
- [ ] Order cancellation works
- [ ] Menu item availability toggle works
- [ ] Order total calculation is correct

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Implementation
- No image upload functionality (URL only)
- No order confirmation workflow
- No notification system for new orders
- No payment gateway integration
- No order status tracking (preparing, ready, delivered)
- No inventory management

### Potential Future Features
- Image upload with file storage
- Order confirmation by canteen staff
- Real-time notifications
- Payment gateway integration (Razorpay, etc.)
- Order status tracking
- Inventory management and stock alerts
- Menu item ratings and reviews
- Popular items highlighting
- Daily/weekly menu specials
- Order history analytics

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security
- JWT authentication on all routes
- Authorization checks for admin operations
- User can only modify their own bookings (or admin can modify any)
- Password hashing (existing in auth system)
- CORS configuration (existing)

### Recommendations
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Add CSRF protection
- Implement proper error handling
- Add logging for audit trail
- Consider adding order amount limits
- Add email verification for new roles

## Performance Considerations

- Database indexes on userId, date for bookings
- Efficient sorting on menu items (by itemName)
- Proper pagination for large order lists (future)
- Image optimization recommendations (if file upload added)

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully integrates a complete canteen management system into the UniTracker application with proper role-based access control, enhances the lost and found functionality with claiming capabilities, and fixes the authentication role selection issue. The solution follows the existing code patterns, maintains consistency with the current UI/UX, and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
