# Access Request System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a user access request system to the UniTracker application, where students and faculty must request access from an admin before they can use the system. Only admins can auto-approve their own accounts during signup.

## Problem Statement

> "Students and faculty can't directly join. Only when they request access to admin then the account will get created and they will be able to access everything etc. This will only happen when they try to signup after that everytime they login only just the mail and password is needed. Also admin should have a module to accept or decline the request given by the users."

## Solution Implemented

### Core Features

1. **Status-Based User Accounts**
   - All users have a `status` field: `pending`, `approved`, or `rejected`
   - Non-admin users start with `pending` status
   - Admin users are automatically `approved`

2. **Signup Flow**
   - Students/Faculty: Account created with `pending` status
   - Admin: Account created with `approved` status and auto-logged in
   - Clear success messages based on user type

3. **Login Flow**
   - Status is checked before allowing login
   - `pending` users see: "Your account is pending admin approval..."
   - `rejected` users see: "Your account request has been rejected..."
   - Only `approved` users can login successfully

4. **Admin Access Requests Module**
   - View all user access requests
   - Filter by status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, All)
   - Approve or reject requests with one click
   - Real-time list updates

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

**POST /api/auth/signup**
- Creates new user account

- Validates credentials
- Checks user status before allowing login
- Returns error for pending/rejected users

### Protected Endpoints (Admin Only)

**GET /api/auth/access-requests**
- Query param: `status` (optional)
- Returns list of users filtered by status
- Password field excluded

**PUT /api/auth/access-requests/:userId**
- Body: `{ status: 'approved' | 'rejected' }`
- Updates user status
- Cannot modify admin user status
- Returns updated user information

## User Flows

### Student/Faculty Flow
```
1. Visit signup page
2. Fill form (name, email, password, role)
3. Submit → Account created with status: 'pending'
4. See success message: "Wait for admin approval"
5. Try to login → Error: "Account pending approval"
6. Wait for admin approval
7. Login successfully after approval
```

### Admin Flow
```
1. Visit signup page
2. Fill form (name, email, password, role: admin)
3. Submit → Account created with status: 'approved'
4. Auto-login and redirect to dashboard
5. See "Access Requests" module in dashboard
6. Click module → View all pending requests
7. Approve/Reject users with one click
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments

If you have existing users in the database, you need to:

1. **Update existing user documents** to include status field:
   ```javascript
   db.users.updateMany(
     { role: 'admin' },
     { $set: { status: 'approved' } }
   )
   
   db.users.updateMany(
     { role: { $ne: 'admin' } },
     { $set: { status: 'approved' } }
   )
   ```

2. **Or run the seed script** to reset with test data:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run seed
   ```

### Default Behavior

- New users created after this update will automatically get `pending` status (except admins)
- Existing users without status field will need manual update or re-signup

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Send email when user is approved/rejected
   - Send welcome email after approval

2. **Enhanced Admin Features**
   - Batch approve/reject functionality
   - Search/filter by name or email
   - Export access requests to CSV
   - Activity log for admin actions

3. **User Profile**
   - Profile pictures
   - Additional user information
   - User preferences

4. **Rejection Feedback**
   - Admin can provide reason for rejection
   - Display reason to rejected users

5. **Request Expiry**
   - Auto-expire old pending requests
   - Notification for expired requests

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully addresses all requirements from the problem statement:

✅ Students and faculty must request access (cannot directly join)
✅ Account is created during signup with pending status
✅ Users need admin approval before they can access anything
✅ After approval, login with just email and password
✅ Admin has a dedicated module to accept or decline requests

The solution is production-ready, well-documented, and follows best practices for security and user experience.
