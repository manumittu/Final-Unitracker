┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              SECURITY LAYERS                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Authentication    → JWT Token Required          │
│  2. Authorization     → Admin Role Check            │
│  3. Business Rules    → No Admin/Self Deletion      │
│  4. User Confirmation → Frontend Dialog             │
│  5. Audit Trail       → Response Logging            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Security Test Results
- ✅ Admin-only access enforced (403 for non-admins)
- ✅ Authentication required (401 for unauthenticated)
- ✅ Admin deletion blocked (400 error)
- ✅ Self-deletion blocked (400 error)
- ✅ Invalid user handled (404 error)

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Endpoint Design
- **Decision**: Use `/api/auth/users/:userId` path
- **Rationale**: Keeps user management under auth routes
- **Benefit**: Consistent with existing patterns

### 2. UI Placement
- **Decision**: Add to Access Requests module
- **Rationale**: Admins already use this for user management
- **Benefit**: No new UI screens needed

### 3. Confirmation Dialog
- **Decision**: Use browser confirm() dialog
- **Rationale**: Simple, standard, accessible
- **Benefit**: No additional UI components needed

### 4. Security Approach
- **Decision**: Multi-layer security checks
- **Rationale**: Defense in depth principle
- **Benefit**: Robust protection against misuse

### 5. Error Handling
- **Decision**: Specific error messages for each scenario
- **Rationale**: Better user experience
- **Benefit**: Easier troubleshooting
