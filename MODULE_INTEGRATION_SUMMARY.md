# Module Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Quiz Management, Timetable Management, and Bus Reservation modules into the UniTracker application with proper role-based access control.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### a. Middleware Enhancement (`backend/middleware/auth.js`)
