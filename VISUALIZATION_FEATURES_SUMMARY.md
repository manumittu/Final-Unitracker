## Technical Implementation

### Library Used
- **recharts** v2.12.0 (already in package.json dependencies)

### Components Imported
```javascript
import { 
  PieChart, 
  Pie, 
  Cell, 
  BarChart, 
  Bar, 
  XAxis, 
  YAxis, 
  Tooltip, 
  Legend, 
  ResponsiveContainer 
} from 'recharts';
```

### Responsive Design Strategy
1. All charts wrapped in `ResponsiveContainer` with `width="100%"`
2. Fixed heights for consistency (300px or 350px)
3. Grid layouts that adapt to screen size:
   - Desktop: Multi-column grids
   - Tablet: 2-column or stacked
   - Mobile: Single column stack

### Card Design
- Uses existing Card components from `../../components/ui/card`
- Consistent CardHeader and CardContent structure
- CardTitle for headings
- CardDescription for subtitles
