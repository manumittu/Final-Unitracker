## Testing
To test the visualizations:
1. Start the backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Login and navigate to each module:
   - **Quiz Module**: Create/attempt a quiz to see result visualizations
   - **Courses Module**: View courses to see statistics and charts
   - **Projects Module**: View projects to see status distribution

## Build Status
✓ Frontend builds successfully with all visualizations
✓ No compilation errors
✓ All charts properly integrated with existing UI components
